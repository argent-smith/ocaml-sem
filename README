This is OCaml "Sem" library. It is intended to be a first (AFAIK) try to
implement POSIX semaphores in OCaml.

Further documentation on library installation and usage you may find in
INSTALL and sem.mli files.

The library was made following the pattern of POSIX semaphore infrastructure
of FreeBSD.

Since it's an early, alpha you are welcome to change it or suggest new ideas
in order to make it useable on any platform of your fantasy ;).

DONE:
- alpha building and testing on FreeBSD-5 platform.

TODO:
- port of C part to other platforms (if needed);
- automake/autoconf support (contributors are welcome);
- higher order functions implementing an easy-to-use high level interface to
  the library;
- OO implementation for the fans ;)

BUGS:
- all sem* calls using a handle of a closed semaphore (after sem_close) lead
  to a core dump (signals either 6 or 11) as tested on FreeBSD-5. This issue
  has its roots somewhere deeply inside libc or kernel, I dunno as for now.

NOTES:
- you have to enable POSIX semaphores in your OS kernel in order to use the
  functions described under "Named semaphores operation" in sem.mli file.
